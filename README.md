# whqIRCbot
PHP based IRC bot used by WineHQ #winehackers on FreeNode.net

This project started as a joke just to see if I could write an IRC bot
in PHP. It turns out it was somewhat useful and more stable than
predicted.

Interesting features:

 * Can connect over TLS
 * Can authenticate with SASL
 * has callback timers
 * IRC color code support

How to Use:

 * Edit whqBot.php to taste. There are some sample callbacks provided.
 * Good Luck!
